# Data Structures on Go

In this repository I plan to implemment data structres in Go. The code is based on the book
Kommadi - Learn data structures and algorithms with golang.

## Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree is a non-linear data structure that sorts elements that are greater than a given
value on the left branch and less than a given value on the right branch. The space complexity of this
structure is O(N) and time complexity of searching in this structure is O(log N), where N is the number
of elements on the binary tree.
